I want to work on a long term machine learning project to practice my skills. The idea is that I take images of clash of clans bases and detect 1) what all of the objects are (town hall, air defense, wizard tower, etc.) and 2) what the locations of those objects are. I then want to find weak points in the bases (i.e. areas with less defenses or areas with defenses that lack variety i.e. weak to air troops or weak to ground troops). I then want the model to suggest places to attack + troops to use in the attack (which would depend on how the weak point is structured i.e. if the weak point is a place with 2 mortars and 1 single beam inferno tower, it is pretty weak to air attacks and specifically dragons)
